            The cost of each <SpanAccent>Lucky</SpanAccent> Gachapon ticket - 6
            DOTs, will be used toward supporting clover to secure its polkadot
            parachain slot fully. Your gachapon is fully refundable if clover
            finance did not secure a slot

            Genesis LUCKY will only be generated if Clover Finance receives
            enough DOTs from this campaign or from the Polkadot Parachain
            auction crowdloan which enables it to secure a Polkadot Parachain
            slot.

            The DOTs we raised from the Lucky Gachapon sale will be used to
            support Clover Finance on paying its 24 months leasing fee if it
            becomes a Polkadot Parachain. Once the 24 months Polkadot Parachain
            leasing period is over, the DOTs you paid for your Lucky Gachapon
            will be fully returned.

            When Clover Finance becomes a Polkadot Parachain, you receive 6

            purchased.
